Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed to enable the
controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented independently
of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.
These sorts of identifiers often utilize a heavy-weight registry, such as ones
utilizing Decentralized Ledger Technologies (DLT), to create, read, update,
and deactivate DIDs. This specification describes a non-registry based DID
Method based on expanding a cryptographic public key into a DID Document. This
approach provides the simplest possible implementation of a DID Method that
is able to achieve many, but not all, of the benefits of utilizing DIDs.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) [[DID-CORE]] are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed
to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented
independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate
authority. These sorts of identifiers often utilize a heavy-weight registry,
such as ones utilizing Decentralized Ledger Technologies (DLT), to create, read,
update, and deactivate DIDs.
      </p>

      <p>
While DLT-based DID Methods have great decentralization characteristics, and
some of the more centralized DID Methods provide strong system control
guarantees, the general approaches tend to be expensive to setup and operate.
Some use cases requiring DIDs do not need the guarantees provided by these
heavy-weight systems. For example, a DID that will only be used for a single,
ephemeral interaction might not need to be registered, updated, or deactivated.
It is for this class of use cases that the <tt>did:key</tt> method exists.
      </p>

      <p>
The rest of this document outlines the syntax for the <tt>did:key</tt> method,
the operations it supports, and some security and privacy considerations that
implementers might want to be aware of when implementing.
      </p>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2 id="format">The did:key Format</h2>

      <p>
The format for the <tt>did:key</tt> method conforms to the [[DID-CORE]]
specification and is simple. It consists of the <code>did:key</code> prefix,
followed by a Multibase [[MULTIBASE]] base58-btc encoded value that is a
concatenation of the Multicodec [[MULTICODEC]] identifier for the public key
type and the raw bytes associated with the public key format.
      </p>

      <p>
The ABNF for the key format is described below:
      </p>

      <pre>
did-key-format := did:key:&lt;mb-value>
mb-value       := z[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]+
      </pre>

      <p>
Alternatively, the encoding rules can also be thought of as the application
of a series of transformation functions on the raw public key bytes:
      </p>

      <tt>
did-key-format := did:key:MULTIBASE(base58-btc, MULTICODEC(public-key-type, raw-public-key-bytes))
      </tt>

      <p>
A simple example of a valid Ed25519 <tt>did:key</tt> DID is:
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="A simple Ed25519 did:key value">
did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH
      </pre>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Operations</h2>

      <p>
The following section outlines the DID operations for the <tt>did:key</tt>
method. Implementers might note that this DID Method is purely generative,
requiring no look ups in a registry. Since <tt>did:key</tt> values are not
stored in any registry, they cannot be updated or deactivated.
      </p>

      <section class="normative">
        <h3>Create</h3>

        <p>
Creating a <tt>did:key</tt> value consists of creating a cryptographic key pair
and encoding the public key using the format provided in  Section <a
href="#format"></a>. The creation of a DID Document is also performed by taking
the public key value and expanding it into DID Document. An example is given
below that expands the ed25519 <tt>did:key</tt>
<code>did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH</code> into its
associated DID Document:
